# Project Title

Py-Encoder

## Description

The Py-Encoder is a Python-based tool for manipulating data in Excel. Its task is to automate the given data from an Excel file to a formatted one for data migration. This project was created while I was training at ASTRO Shipping Management Inc.

2. Copy an excel file to the project's src folder.
3. Start encoding by selecting an option from the main menu.
